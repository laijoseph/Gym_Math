Lifting is hard; figuring out the plates doesn't have to be.

I came up with the idea for this project when I was working out with friends. My friends and I have a sizable gap in the weight of our working sets, and we kept taking off plates to put on different plates in between our sets. I figured that there had to be a better way to decide which plates to use to add up to a desired weight. The bumper plates at our gym are the same size from 10 lbs to 45 lbs(stackable, as I like to call it), while 2.5 and 5 lbs are not. This calculator uses the most number of stackable weights as possible for the lesser working set so that the users won't have to waste energy unloading and loading unnecessary plates.

For example, if the two working weights for two squat buddies are 195 lbs and 265 lbs...

Traditionally, we would stack the plates of 45, 25, and a 5 on each side of the 45 pound barbell for 195.
To get to 265, we would take the 25 and 5 off, then put on 45, and two 10's. This results in the moving five weights on each side, ten total, equating to 190 lbs.

If you plugged in 195 and 265 into Gym Math, the app will tell you to stack on three plates of 25's on each side for 195, and only add a 35 on each side to reach 265 lbs, resulting in only adding or subtracting 70 lbs between sets.

When the app isn't used to determine weight differences between two friends, users can also use it to determine which weights to use to achieve a desired weight. For example, if Fred and George are deadlifting 485 lbs at the gym today, they can leave the lower weight field empty (default is 45), and plug in 485 in the upper weight. Gym Math will tell them to load four plates of 45's, a 35, and a 5 on each side.

I chose to create this calculator in the form of an Android app because I've always wanted to explore Android Studio and learn more about Android development. Along the way, I also learned how to use XML to create a user interface.
